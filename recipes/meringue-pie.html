    <br><h2>Orange Meringue Pie</h2>
        <p> A nice change from lemon meringue. A unique flavor.</p>
    <br><h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (9 inch) unbaked pie crust</li>
            <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 cup orange juice</li>
            <li>½ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter or margarine, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons grated orange zest</li>
            <li>½ cup diced orange segments</li>
            <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        </ul>
    <br><h3>Steps:</h3>   
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Line pastry with aluminum foil and a layer of pie weights or dried beans. 
            <br>Bake in the preheated oven until edge of crust is golden, about 10 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and weights; bake about 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>In a small saucepan, stir together the 3/4 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cornstarch, and salt. Mix in the orange juice, lemon juice, and water. Whisk in the egg yolks.
            <br>Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until thick and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in butter and orange zest. If desired; stir in diced orange segments. Pour into prepared pie crust, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside to cool.</li>
            <li>When pie filling has cooled to room temperature, preheat oven and prepare meringue. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            <br>In a large glass or metal bowl, beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add 1/2 cup sugar and cream of tartar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. 
            <br>Spread over pie, making sure the meringue completely covers the filling and meets the edges of the pie crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until meringue topping is golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
